# CsPaint

my first coding assignment

- Basic Drawing Functions (Stage 1 & 2):
  - Developed commands to draw lines and fill squares on a digital canvas using integer inputs.
  - Enhanced line drawing and square filling functionalities to handle more complex drawing scenarios.
- Advanced Drawing Commands (Stage 3):
  - Implemented the Copy-Paste command, allowing sections of the canvas to be copied and pasted elsewhere.
  - Created the Draw Ellipse command to color in ellipses, including support for both filled and hollow ellipses based on input parameters.
- Handling Complex Canvas Manipulations (Stage 4):
  - Ensured proper handling of overlapping copy-paste operations, allowing for complex and layered drawings.
  - Enhanced the Draw Ellipse command to support hollow ellipses when specified by input, adding versatility to the drawing capabilities.
